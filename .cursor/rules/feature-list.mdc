## Feature 1: Voice-Based Conversation (E2E)
### 📄 Description

Enable users to converse with a voice agent that transcribes user speech and responds via natural-sounding voice.

> As a user, I want to speak to the assistant and hear its response so that I can interact hands-free in a natural way.

---

### 🧪 Acceptance Criteria

-  Scenario 1: Given mic input, when the user speaks, then it is transcribed accurately.
-  Scenario 2: Given a transcription, when processed, then a voice response is generated and played.
-  Scenario 3: If TTS fails, then a fallback to text display is used.

---

### 🛠️ Technical Notes

> - Backend endpoints: `/transcribe`, `/speak`>     
> - Frontend: Mic recorder, audio playbac component
>     
> - Uses GPT-4o for STT and OpenAI/ElevenLabs for TTS
>     

---

### 📦 Dependencies

> - OpenAI API Key
>     
> - Audio recorder in frontend
>     

---

### 🎨 UI/UX (optional)

> - Waveform during mic input
>     
> - Real-time transcription display
>     
> - Voice playback bubble
>     

## Feature 2: Voice Agent Web Search (E2E)

### 📄 Description

Enable the voice agent to perform web searches based on user input and return summarized results.

> As a user, I want the assistant to search the internet and summarize answers so I can get information quickly.

---

### 🧪 Acceptance Criteria

-  Scenario 1: Given a search question, when the user speaks, then the assistant performs a web search and speaks a summary.
    
-  Scenario 2: If the web search fails, then an appropriate error message is shown.
    

---

### 🛠️ Technical Notes

> - Backend endpoint: `/search`
>     
> - Uses Bing/SerpAPI and GPT-4o summarization
>     
> - Frontend: voice → query → response as audio/text
>     

---

### 📦 Dependencies

> - Web search API key
>     
> - OpenAI API
>     

---

### 🎨 UI/UX (optional)

> - Loader during search
>     
> - Result in expandable card with links
>     

## Feature 3: CUA Command Execution (E2E)

### 📄 Description

Allow the voice agent to recognize intent from commands and execute them using connected APIs.

> As a user, I want the assistant to take action on commands (e.g., buy a book) so I can get things done via voice.

---
### 🧪 Acceptance Criteria

-  Scenario 1: Given a command, when the assistant detects intent, then it confirms the action.
    
-  Scenario 2: After confirmation, the assistant performs the action and returns a result.
    

---
### 🛠️ Technical Notes

> - Backend endpoints: `/intent`, `/action`
> - Intent classification via GPT-4o
> - CUA registry to map actions
>     

---

### 📦 Dependencies

> - APIs for CUA actions (e.g., Amazon)
> - OpenAI for intent parsing

---

### 🎨 UI/UX (optional)

> - Confirmation dialog before execution
>     
> - Result card after action completes
>     

## Feature 4: Prompt Configurator (Admin Only)

### 📄 Description

Provide a UI for admins to customize prompts used by the assistant (e.g., tone, system behavior).

> As an admin, I want to configure the assistant's prompt so I can control how it behaves and responds.

---

### 🧪 Acceptance Criteria

-  Scenario 1: Given a text input, when saved, then the prompt is stored and used in future sessions.
    
-  Scenario 2: Prompt changes are reflected immediately or on restart.
    

---

### 🛠️ Technical Notes

> - Admin UI in frontend
>     
> - Backend endpoint to update prompt file or memory
>     
> - Secure admin route
>     

---

### 📦 Dependencies

> - Auth system for admin
>     
> - Storage for prompt config (DB, file)
>     

---

### 🎨 UI/UX (optional)

> - Text editor for prompt with syntax highlighting
>     
> - Save & preview button
