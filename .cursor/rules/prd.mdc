## Product Title

**Conversational Voice Agent (CVA)**
## Purpose

To build a Siri-like AI voice assistant using OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4o capabilities that allows natural voice interaction, performs intelligent web searches, and executes real-world tasks using Conversational User Actions (CUA).

## Goals

- Enable users to interact using voice in a fluid, human-like manner.
- Provide accurate and real-time transcription using GPT-4o.
- Deliver high-quality spoken responses.
- Execute commands or tasks such as "buy a book" or "set a reminder."
- Retrieve and summarize relevant information from the web
    

## Features

### 1. Jazzy Conversational UI

- Voice waveform animations
- Conversational avatar or stylish chat bubbles
- Real-time feedback and transitions

### 2. Speech-to-Text via GPT-4o Transcriber

- Mic input capture
- Real-time audio chunking
- Transcription via GPT-4o API

### 3. Text-to-Speech (TTS)

- Natural voice playback via OpenAI TTS or ElevenLabs
- Visual cue while speaking
- Retry and fallback system

### 4. Web Search

- Triggered for knowledge-seeking queries
- Integrate with web search APIs (e.g., SerpAPI, Bing, Brave)
- Summarize responses using GPT

### 5. Conversational Understanding
- Use GPT-4o for maintaining conversation state
- Manage follow-ups and clarification

### 6. Command Execution via CUA
- Parse intents and entities
- Execute external APIs (e.g., Amazon, Google Calendar)
- Confirmation dialog before actions

### 7. Settings & Personalization
- Select TTS voice, themes, and assistant style
- Toggle search and action capabilities

## Non-Goals

- Supporting offline or on-device STT/TTS.
- Multi-language support in initial version.

## Users

- General users looking for a hands-free assistant
- Tech-savvy users exploring GPT-powered automation

## Assumptions

- Users have stable internet connectivity
- Users will authenticate for third-party services (e.g., Amazon)

## Out of Scope

- No deep integration with proprietary OS-level apps (e.g., iOS native calendar)
- No support for continuous passive listening ("Hey Siri"-style wake word)

## Milestones

1. Prototype with STT, TTS, and GPT-4o integration
2. Functional web search & summarization
3. Modular CUA intent engine
4. Final UI polish & deployment on Azure

## Success Metrics

- <2s transcription latency
- > 90% transcription accuracy
- > 85% task recognition accuracy
- > 75% user satisfaction in usability testing
